# Life Infrastructure Tracker

Life Infrastructure Tracker is a Vite + React web app that turns household logistics into a cooperative RPG-style experience. Track essentials, stay ahead of bills, earn points, and collaborate with housemates‚Äîall with Tailwind styling and an OpenAI-powered game-master assistant. All data lives in LocalStorage for a lightweight, offline-friendly workflow.

## Features
- **Gamified Dashboard** with a household health bar, points, levels, badges, streak tracking, and personal growth momentum.
- **Essentials Inventory** CRUD with pantry/fridge/freezer locations, automatic "days left" math, and low-supply highlights.
- **Bills & Utilities** management including mark-as-paid actions, urgency emojis, and reminders for due/overdue invoices.
- **Reminders & Notifications** powered by the browser Notification API‚Äîearn points for responding to alerts.
- **AI Game Master** (OpenAI Chat Completions) that narrates quests, congratulates wins, and nudges you when supplies run low.
- **Household Guild** so family or roommates can join via invite code, compare streaks, and tackle seasonal challenges together.
- **Personal Growth Layer** to track fitness, reading, savings, or custom missions that feed into the household health bar and reward milestones.
- **Tailwind UI** with dark mode, responsive layouts, and emoji-rich feedback for a playful experience.

## Getting Started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

The dev server runs at http://localhost:5173 by default.

## Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the project root with your OpenAI API key:

```
VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-key-here
```

The assistant uses `import.meta.env.VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY` to authorize requests to `https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions`.

## Notifications
Click **üîî Enable reminders** in the header to grant notification permissions. Once granted, daily alerts summarize ‚ö†Ô∏è low supplies and üí∏ bills due soon‚Äîand acknowledging them awards bonus points.

## Location Sharing
Use **üìç Share location** to capture your approximate latitude/longitude via the browser Geolocation API. This stays local and helps contextualize your planning sessions.

## Gamification Loop
- Add or restock essentials ‚Üí earn points and keep the household health bar green.
- Mark bills as paid on time ‚Üí extend streaks and unlock the **Utility Master** badge.
- Maintain buffer days for supplies ‚Üí work toward **Preparedness Pro**.
- Invite housemates ‚Üí combine points for seasonal challenges like the "Preparedness Challenge" and vie for titles such as **Chief Household Strategist**.
